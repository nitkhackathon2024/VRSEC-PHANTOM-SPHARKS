## Quantum Detective: Cracking Financial Anomalies
Theme: Quantum Computing
The task is to build a quantum machine learning model to detect fraudulent financial transactions. Traditional machine learning models struggle with large datasets, while quantum computing can analyze them faster and more accurately using qubits, superposition, and entanglement.



Hereâ€™s an updated version for a Jupyter Notebook setup:

## **Instructions on Running Your Project**

### 1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhinav1475/VRSEC-PHANTOM-SPHARKS.git
cd VRSEC-PHANTOM-SPHARKS
```

### 2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**
In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory and start Jupyter:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

### 3. **Install Dependencies**
The necessary libraries will be installed via the cells in the notebook, so you don't need to manually install them. Simply run the first few cells to install dependencies like PennyLane, Qiskit, and others.

### 4. **Download the Dataset**
Download the **Credit Card Fraud Dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) and ensure it is placed in the correct path as referenced in the notebook.

### 5. **Run the Notebook**
Run each cell in the notebook in sequence. It includes both the quantum and classical models, so you'll be able to see:
- Data preprocessing
- Quantum and classical model training
- Visualizations
- Performance comparisons

You're ready to go! Just run the notebook step-by-step.
